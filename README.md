# My Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to my React Portfolio. The tech stack used to create this portfolio app consisted of React, Vite, Bootstrap, NodeJs, and more. This portfolio contains information about me and my projects, and has a page to contact me if you'd like to work with me. Below is a screenshot of and a link to my deployed application on Netlify.
